[Demo](http://pokersolver.scorpio.design)

  * Enter your Poker hand in the first box
  * Enter your friend's/enemy's (however you see them) Poker hand in the second box
  * Hit submit!
  *	You will get an alert box with: 1 if you won, 2 if you lost or 3 if it's a tie, as well as some accompanying text.

I appreciate any suggestions, bug fixes and feedback â˜º
